# Gate-Drift

A Minecraft Modpack

Gate Drift: Echoes of the Void
A stranded Ancient ship. A flickering stargate. Worlds unknown—yours to explore, or abandon.

Gate Drift is a sci-fi survival-adventure modpack where players awaken aboard a crumbling Ancient ship drifting through deep space. Every few in-game days, its onboard stargate dials a new planet—each one procedurally generated, resource-rich, and filled with unknown threats.

Features
Stargate Exploration
Travel to alien worlds using Just Stargate Mod with immersive dialing sequences, naquadah-powered systems, and alien architecture.
Survival Systems
Manage temperature, hydration, and injury using mods like Tough As Nails and First Aid. Survival is about more than hearts and hunger bars.
Dynamic Planet Generation
Each stargate destination offers new biomes, hazards, and structures with Oh The Biomes You'll Go, RFTools Dimensions, and Weather 2.
Tech-Driven Ship Systems
Outfit and operate the ship’s failing infrastructure with OpenComputers, AE2, Valkyrien Skies, and immersive storage options.
Crew & Missions
Interact with CustomNPCs-based characters who deliver tasks, dialogue, and upgrades as you explore the ship’s past and future.
High-Stakes Decisions
Choose to return to the ship—or stay behind on a planet forever. Settlement mechanics allow for branching progression and personal risk.
Gameplay Loop
Dial into an unknown world. Scavenge resources, salvage tech, complete missions, or settle off-grid. Then dial again. Your ship won't wait.
